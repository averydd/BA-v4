dex_events collections: amount0 and amount1 are present, 
meaning an arbitrary trade (don't know which direction
but it is a trade lol) amount0_in and amount1_out present
meaning directional trade happen in the pool (tokenA is
released by user into the pool--amount0_in and tokenB is
going from the pool "out" to the user--amount1_out)

potential issue: how to understand if amount0 amount1 mean
something else?
potential: link dex_events with knowledge_graph["smart_contract"]
by contract_address to view the details

amount fields are in original token price value, not in ETH.
